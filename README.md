Recipe Recommendation System

##Overview

The Recipe Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that predicts recipes based on nutritional components such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and food item names. The system helps users find suitable recipes tailored to their dietary preferences and nutritional needs.

##Features

Nutrient-Based Recipe Prediction: Suggests recipes based on carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and other nutritional values.

Ingredient-Based Search: Users can enter a food item, and the system recommends recipes containing it.

Healthy Eating Guidance: Helps users find recipes that align with their dietary goals (e.g., high-protein, low-carb, etc.).

User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use web interface for searching and viewing recipes.

##Technologies Used

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model training)

Flask (For backend development)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (For frontend)

Pandas & NumPy (For data handling and preprocessing)



##Dataset

The system uses a dataset containing nutritional values (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, calories) along with food items and corresponding recipes. The dataset is preprocessed and used to train a machine learning model for accurate recommendations.

##How It Works

User Input: Enter a food item or specify nutritional values.

Recipe Prediction: The trained model predicts suitable recipes based on the input.

Results Display: The system displays a list of recommended recipes with nutritional details.




##Future Enhancements

Adding user preferences for dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, keto).

Improving model accuracy with deep learning techniques.

Mobile app integration for on-the-go recipe recommendations.
